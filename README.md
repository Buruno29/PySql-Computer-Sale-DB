# PySql-Computer-Sale-DB
Computer sales PySQL miniproject 

this was a practical activity I did with a few colleagues in college as we studied "Database Applications" subject.

Its intent is to Mimic a database for Computers' sale, but can be adapted if you understand it well.
Aditional instructions are available within the readme within "ComputerSale PySql" folder, should any problem occur while using the codes, 
a direction could be useful:
1-Execute '0create db.py'
2-Execute all the '...tablecreate.py' files
3-now you can start working with the "insert.py" files
